# 32-Bit-Pipelined-Processor-Based-on-RISC-Architecture
This project implements a 32-bit pipelined RISC processor using Verilog, designed to execute instructions efficiently by leveraging instruction-level parallelism through a 5-stage pipeline: Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Execution (EX), Memory Access (MEM), and Write Back (WB). The processor adheres to the MIPS instruction set architecture, supporting arithmetic, logical, memory, and branch instructions while handling hazards using forwarding and branch prediction techniques. It features flexible pipelining, dynamically switching between 4-stage and 5-stage pipelines based on instruction type to reduce latency, along with thermal management through dynamic frequency scaling for stability and power efficiency. Additionally, clock gating is implemented to reduce dynamic power consumption during idle or halt states. The design was synthesized and simulated using Quartus and ModelSim, with simulations demonstrating efficient instruction execution and improved throughput due to pipelining, validating core functionalities through arithmetic, logical, load/store, and branch instruction tests. This project serves as a practical implementation of pipelined RISC architecture and its challenges on FPGA-based systems for learning and further extension.
